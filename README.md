# AI Theory Notes (Modules 1–5)

These notes are organized to match a 5-module AI theory syllabus and typical university **mock-exam patterns (Q1–Q5)**.

## Modules

1. [Module 1: Intelligent Agents](Module%201%20Intelligent%20Agents.md)
2. [Module 2: AI Problem Solving and Genetic Algorithms](Module%202%20AI%20Problem%20Solving%20and%20Genetic%20Algorithms.md)
3. [Module 3: Constraint Satisfaction Problems](Module%203%20Constraint%20Satisfaction%20Problems.md)
4. [Module 4: Knowledge Representation and Logical Reasoning](Module%204%20Knowledge%20Representation%20and%20Logical%20Reasoning.md)
5. [Module 5: Probabilistic Reasoning and Naive Bayes Classification](Module%205%20Probabilistic%20Reasoning%20and%20Naive%20Bayes%20Classification.md)

> Note: ANN basics are included as **Optional** inside Module 5 (kept intentionally).

## Mock Exam Map (Q1–Q5)

- **Q1 (Agents)** → Module 1
  - Use: PEAS + PAGE + agent architecture selection
- **Q2 (Problem Solving / GA)** → Module 2
  - Use: problem formulation + GA operators + comparison (GA vs brute force / GA vs uninformed search / GA vs greedy)
- **Q3 (CSP)** → Module 3
  - Use: convert scenario into variables/domains/constraints + show a solution
- **Q4 (Logic / KR / Inference)** → Module 4
  - Use: policy/facts/claim → CNF → resolution proof
- **Q5 (Probability / Naive Bayes / Text)** → Module 5
  - Use: priors + likelihoods + Bayes/Naive Bayes; keyword-table classification template

## Syllabus Checklist (Quick)

- **Module 1:** PEAS, PAGE properties, agent types (simple reflex/model-based/goal-based/utility-based/learning), autonomous agents, multi-agent systems
- **Module 2:** problem formulation, state space, optimization problems, Genetic Algorithms (population/chromosome/fitness/selection/crossover/mutation), GA vs uninformed search comparison
- **Module 3:** CSP definition & components, constraint types, NLP → CSP formulation, consistency idea, exam scheduling, resource allocation
- **Module 4:** KR basics, propositional logic, predicate logic basics, KB construction (policy/facts/claims), implication elimination + CNF + clause form, resolution + contradiction proof + entailment, graph-based KR (semantic networks/knowledge graphs/conceptual dependency)
- **Module 5:** probability fundamentals (prior/conditional/posterior, Bayes), Naive Bayes (conditional independence, features/binary vectors, text/spam filtering), ANN basics (optional)

## How to Study (Suggested)

1. Start each module with the **definitions + core tables**.
2. Move to **Solved Exam Questions** sections.
3. Use the **Mock Exam Pattern** blocks as your answer structure.
4. Finish with **Practice Problems**.
